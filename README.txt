Features
In my NetWalk application, it contains the following:
-	Main Menu
-	Difficulty Section
-	Help Section
-	Game Section
-	Grid Generator
-	Grid Scrambler
-	GestureListener for Rotating the Grid
-	Win Game Message
-	Background Music
-	Mute Music Button
-	Score System

Main Menu
In the main menu, it contains the logo of the game as well as 3 buttons the player can interact with. 
The first button takes the player to the main game section where a grid will be generated and scrambled for the player to solve. The size of the grid depends on what difficulty the game is on. 

Difficulty Section
In the difficulty section, contains the logo of the game with 3 buttons. Each button changes the grid size for the game. ‘Easy’ changes the grid size to be 5x5, ‘Medium’ changes the grid size to be 7x7 and ‘Hard’ changes the size to be 9x9. When the player changes the difficulty, a message will appear confirming it.

Help Section
In this section, like the Main Menu and the Difficulty section, the section contains the logo of the game. Underneath the logo will have a brief summary so that new players have a better understanding on how to play the game properly.

Game Section
In this section, there will have a Grid of 5 x 5, 7x7 or 9x9 depending on the difficulty. The grid will also be scrambled properly and a score at the bottom of the screen.

Background Music
I added background music in the application that also has a mute button in the main menu. The song is ‘Happy Chiptune’ by Soniau.
